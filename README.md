1. Making Changes in Forked Repo from VS Code
Once a repository is forked on GitHub, developers can make local changes using VS Code and subsequently push those modifications to their forked repository on GitHub. This workflow enables developers to contribute to projects without directly altering the original repository. By making changes locally, developers can experiment, refine, and test their contributions before sharing them with the broader community. Once the changes are ready, developers can use Git commands, such as `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`, to synchronize their local changes with the forked repository on GitHub, thereby facilitating collaboration and contributing to the open-source ecosystem.

2. Creating Pull Request from New Branch
After implementing changes in your newly created branch, you have the option to submit these modifications for review and potential integration into the main branch of the repository by initiating a pull request on GitHub. This pull request serves as a formalized proposal, allowing collaborators and maintainers to assess the proposed alterations, provide feedback, and ensure alignment with project standards. By creating a pull request, you facilitate transparent collaboration, enabling stakeholders to scrutinize the changes before merging them into the main branch. This process promotes code quality, fosters collaboration, and ensures that only validated modifications are incorporated into the project's primary codebase.
